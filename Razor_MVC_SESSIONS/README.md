Welcome to my razor mvc sessions project.

This project was to demonstrate the usage of sessions in c# razor.


You will start on the Index page which is just the landing page direction the user to the registrations page.
The registration page has 3 parts
1) the user is greeted with a select dropdown to select a student.
2) once user has selected a student to register they are greeted with the available courses to register. they are then able to select the courses and click register.
3) once the student is registered for a course/courses the form changes to a list of the registered courses with an input for their grades.

you are able to select another student from the drop down to register / edit their grades and then go back to a previous student and retain all their data.
you are also able to sort the table by course code, course title, and grade by asc or desc order.


the form is able to remember the selected student on get due to the session variables, as well as the order by asc or desc.
