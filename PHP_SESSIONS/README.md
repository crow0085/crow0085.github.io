Welcome to my php sessions project.

This project was to demonstrate the usage of sessions in php.



You will start on the Index page. then in order to progress you must agree to the terms of service. once you have agreed to the tos you are able to input user information. once user information is validated you are then able to move onto the deposit calculator. and finally you can go to the complete page. which will display a thank you message as well as clear the session  to start again

All form fields will be retained on page load due to sessions as well as the usage of sessions allows for page redirects if conditions are not met.
